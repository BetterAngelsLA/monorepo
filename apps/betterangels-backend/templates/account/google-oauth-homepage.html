                <p>
                    When a user connects with Google, we collect their OpenID, email, and profile information to create an account within the Better Angels system. No other Google data is collected. This information is used solely for account creation and authentication purposes.

                    Better Angels provides tools for those in the homeless ecosystem to track an unhoused individual's journey through various services such as housing, medical care, and workforce development. The platform offers shelters tools to book, list, and manage their shelters, and allows unhoused clients to self-service their shelter needs, all the way to permanent housing.
                </p>
                <p>The app also enables caseworkers to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Track cases in a way that allows them to easily share information and understand case history.</li>
                    <li>
                        Track housing options and facilitate attribute matching so that caseworkers and homeless individuals can easily find suitable units.
                    </li>
                    <li>Match people with available services and shelters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Service providers benefit from reporting tools that ensure their data is up-to-date and accurately reflects the impact they are making for their clients and within their community. The app uses role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption to protect any entered user data.
