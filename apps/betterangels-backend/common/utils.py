def get_interaction_attachment_file_path(instance: Model, filename: str) -> str:
    """
    Generates a unique path for storing an uploaded file by appending a UUID to the
    file's original name, preserving its extension. Designed for use in Django's
    FileField or ImageField 'upload_to' parameter, it ensures each file has a unique
    name and organizes files in the 'attachments/' directory.

    Parameters:
    - instance (models.Model): The model instance the file is attached to. Not used in
      this function, but required for 'upload_to'.
    - filename (str): The original filename, used to keep the file extension.

    Returns:
    - str: The unique file storage path, combining 'attachments/' and the UUID-named
      file.

    Example:
        Use in a Django model to ensure uploaded files are uniquely named and organized.
        file = models.FileField(upload_to=get_interaction_attachment_file_path)
