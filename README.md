## Project Overview

BetterAngels is a nonprofit organization focused on addressing the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles and across the nation. This monorepo contains the core applications that power our platform, including mobile apps, web apps, and backend services.

## Frontend Development

The frontend is built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and uses [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) for development across multiple platforms.

- **[Frontend Development Guide](docs/frontend_readme.md)**: This guide covers setting up the development environment, running the application, and testing.

## Backend Development

The backend is built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python web framework, and uses [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) for distributed task processing.

- **[Backend Development Guide](docs/backend_readme.md)**: This guide covers setting up the development environment, running the backend server, and integrating Celery for task processing.

## Development Workflow

To maintain a consistent and efficient development process, we have established a workflow that includes branch management, pull requests, and code reviews.

- **[Development Workflow Guide](docs/development_workflow.md)**: This document outlines our development practices, including how to create branches, submit pull requests, and conduct code reviews.
