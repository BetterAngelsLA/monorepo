# BetterAngels Monorepo

Welcome to the BetterAngels Monorepo! This repository contains the codebases for both the frontend and backend components of the BetterAngels project. Our goal is to address homelessness through innovative technology solutions.

## Project Overview

BetterAngels is a nonprofit organization focused on addressing the homelessness epidemic in Los Angeles. This monorepo contains the core applications that power our platform, including mobile apps, web apps, and backend services.

## Frontend Development

The frontend is built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and uses [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) for development across multiple platforms.

- **[Frontend Development Guide](docs/frontend_readme.md)**: This guide covers setting up the development environment, running the application, and testing.

## Backend Development

The backend is built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python web framework, and uses [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) for distributed task processing.

- **[Backend Development Guide](docs/backend_readme.md)**: This guide covers setting up the development environment, running the backend server, and integrating Celery for task processing.

## Seed Data

### Users

The following users should exist as part of seed data:

- Agent - can access front-end account as an agent
  - username: agent
  - email: `agent@example.com`
  - password: password
- Client - can access front-end account as a client
  - username: client
  - email: `client@example.com`
  - password: password
- Django Admin - can access backend admin panel
  - username: admin
  - email: `admin@example.com`
  - password: password

## Development Workflow

To maintain a consistent and efficient development process, we have established a workflow that includes branch management, pull requests, and code reviews.

- **[Development Workflow Guide](docs/development_workflow.md)**: This document outlines our development practices, including how to create branches, submit pull requests, and conduct code reviews.

## Shelter DB

Shelter DB is a web project for discovering homeless shelters in LA County. More documentation for Shelter DB Project can be found [here](apps/shelter-web/README.md).
